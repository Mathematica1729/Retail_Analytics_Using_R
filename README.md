# Retail_Analytics_Using_R

This project showcases a comprehensive retail analytics study using the R programming language. The goal of this analysis was to understand current purchasing trends and behaviors, evaluate in-store promotion effectiveness, and inform strategic business decisions for a retail chain.

The methodology and tasks presented in this project reflect those outlined in the Quantium Data Analytics Virtual Experience Program on [The Forage](https://www.theforage.com/simulations/quantium/data-analytics-rqkb), which provides a hands-on opportunity to work through similar projects and develop analytical skills.

## Project Description

The project was carried out in three primary tasks:

### Task 1: Data Preparation and Customer Analytics
Processed and analyzed raw customer transaction data to determine customer segments and purchasing patterns. Emphasis was on cleaning the data, defining metrics, and understanding the drivers of chip purchases.

### Task 2: Experimentation and Uplift Testing
Evaluated the impact of a store trial on sales and customer behaviour. This phase included the selection of appropriate control stores and the assessment of the trial effectiveness using statistical methods.

### Task 3: Analytics and Commercial Application
The final task involved synthesizing insights and forming strategic recommendations from the analytics performed. The report created for this task aimed to inform the clientâ€™s strategy for the upcoming half-year.

## Technologies Used

- R: Main language used for statistical analysis and data visualization.
- R Markdown: Utilized for combining code and formatted text in the analytics reports.
- Excel: Supported in creating charts and graphs for the final presentation.
- PowerPoint: Used to compile the visual presentation based on analytics findings.
